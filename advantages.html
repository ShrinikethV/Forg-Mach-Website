            <p align="center">So it is our first choice to procure the best raw material available and ensure the finished products are as per buyers requirements. </p>
            <p align="center">When incoming a batch of new material, we will first test the chemical composition to check if there is any deviation.</p> 
            <p align="center">In addition, we plan to have a separated material storage area and warehouse materials with different specifications.</p>
            <p align="center">For better management, we plan to distinguish them with different colors for differentiation.</p>
